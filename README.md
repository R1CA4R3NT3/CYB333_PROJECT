# CYB333_PROJECT
ÔÇß	Describes the project objectives and features.
This script is designed to automate the setup of firewall rules on one or more remote Linux servers using SSH key-based authentication. Its core objective is to streamline the process of securing SSH and web access ports by applying ufw (Uncomplicated Firewall) rules remotely.

Script Objectives
- Connect to each server listed in servers.txt via SSH
- Apply standardized firewall rules using sudo ufw
- Support multiple private key paths for SSH authentication fallback
- Provide detailed logging of all operations for audit and troubleshooting
- Offer a --dry-run mode to simulate actions without making real changes

Key Features
- Feature                     - Description | 
- SSH Key Authentication      - Uses one or more .pem or private key files to securely log in to remote machines without passwords. 
- Retry Mechanism             - Attempts multiple retries per host and private key, with exponential backoff if a connection fails.  
- Logging                     - Writes structured logs with timestamps to a firewall_setup_<timestamp>.log file.  
- Firewall Enforcement        - Applies the following commands on each host:<br>ufw allow 22, ufw allow 80, ufw allow 443, and ufw --force enable  
- Dry-Run Mode                - With --dry-run, it logs what would be done without executing any SSH commands. 
- Modular & Scalable          - Reads hostnames/IPs from a text file; easy to extend across dozens of servers.  

How to set up and run code.
    Setup Instructions

      1. Install Prerequisites
          -Make sure Python 3.6+ is installed. Then install the required Python library:
              pip install paramiko
          -Optionally, create a virtual environment first using `python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate`.

      2. Prepare SSH Keys

Ensure your private key files exist and are accessible:

- `jricafrente.pem`
- `CYB333-PROJECT-2_key.pem`

They must match public keys added to the remote servers‚Äô `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` files. The private key path is defined in the script as:

```python
private_key_paths = [
    Path(r"...\jricafrente.pem"),
    Path(r"...\CYB333-PROJECT-2_key.pem")
]
```

üìÅ Tip: Use `ssh-copy-id` or Azure VM creation options to install the public key properly.

---

#### 3. **Create `servers.txt`**

This file should live in the same directory as your script and contain one IP address or hostname per line:

```
20.55.123.45
my-vm.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com
```

Make sure each host:
- Is online and reachable over SSH (port 22)
- Has your public key authorized
- Allows `sudo ufw` commands

---

#### 4. **Configure Your Username**

Edit the line in your script:

```python
username = "your_ssh_user"
```

Change `"your_ssh_user"` to match the user allowed to log in via SSH, such as `azureuser`, `ubuntu`, or `ec2-user`.

---

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the Script

From the terminal:

#### ‚úÖ Run Normally:

```bash
python firewall_setup.py
```

This will:
- Connect to each server listed in `servers.txt`
- Authenticate using your SSH key(s)
- Apply the firewall rules via `sudo ufw`

#### üß™ Run as a Dry Run:

```bash
python firewall_setup.py --dry-run
```

This mode simulates all steps without making changes on the server. Ideal for testing connectivity and configuration.

---

### üßæ What Gets Logged

The script creates a log file named like:

```
firewall_setup_20250701_143215.log
```

It will record connection attempts, success messages, and any errors during execution.
